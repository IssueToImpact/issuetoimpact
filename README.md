# issuetoimpact

This project aims to increase participation in democracy by making issue/legislation advocacy easy and quick for political non-experts.

Our platform that allows a user to search for active legislation by topic and provides all the information t needed to gain a basic understanding of the legislation and then contact their representative.

We combine information from the Illinois General Assembly website with mentions on Twitter along with the contact information for relevant representatives based on the user's location and a generic template for what to write/say. Users can also search for their representative and get back basic information about their record.

## Getting started

Run `source install.sh` to set up virtual environment

`main.py` is the entry point for the application.

## Front end

Our platform is a Django user interface which connects to the sqlite database and queries based on various filters provided by the user.

To provide the user with their representativesâ€™ contact information, the user enters  an address and we connect to the Open States API and return representatives and their contact info (address, phone number, email).  

### To test:

## Back end

Command line arguments:
1. limit (int): set a limit for scraping and twitter api requests (e.g. 10)
2. print_to_screen (bool): print output to screen (to see each section is working)
3. load_from_json (bool): load from json instead of scraping

### To test:
* Scraping and twitter api: `python3 main.py 10 True False` will test both the scraper and twitter api search (limited to 10 requests) and print output to the screen
* File and database making functionality - `python3 main.py None False True`
